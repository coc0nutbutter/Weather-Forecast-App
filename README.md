# Weather-Forecast-App
This repository contains code for a web application that provides weather forecasts. It could be built using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a backend framework like Node.js or Django. The app could fetch weather data from a public API like OpenWeatherMap and display it in a user-friendly interface.
